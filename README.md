go-util
========

Utility packages:

- **go-util** -- not really useful for now (mostly a few typed "iif" funcs to make up for Golang's lack of ternary operators)

- **go-util/gfx** -- not really useful for now

- **go-util/gl** -- all kinds of OpenGL helpers, imports the http://github.com/chsc/gogl/ "gl42" OpenGL binding

- **go-util/io** -- misc helper funcs such as ExtractZipFile, FileExists and the likes...

- **go-util/net** -- not really useful for now

- **go-util/num** -- 3D-focused maths helpers such as Vec2, Vec3, Mat3, Mat4, Quat... (for "sciencier" matrix needs, check out the GoMatrix package on Google Code)

- **go-util/str** -- some recurringly needed string helper funcs
