go-util
========

Utility packages:

- *go-util* -- not really useful for now (mostly a few typed "Iif" funcs to make up for Golang's lack of ternary operators)

- *go-util/gfx* -- not really useful for now

- *go-util/gl* -- all kinds of OpenGL helpers, based on the http://github.com/chsc/gogl/gl42 OpenGL wrapper

- *go-util/io* -- misc utility funcs such as ExtractZipFile, FileExists and the likes...

- *go-util/net* -- not really useful for now

- *go-util/num* -- somewhat incomplete, 3D-focused maths helpers such as Vec2, Vec3, Mat3, Mat4, Quat... for sciencier matrix needs, check out the GoMatrix package

- *go-util/str* -- all sorts of string helpers
